We have been contacted by United Nations Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs, the Philippines Red Cross to assist in providing information management support. Highlights:  On Nov 7h, the Digital Humanitarian Network received an activation request from the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  (UNOCHA) to support needs for Typhoon Yolanda.   Super Typhoon Yolanda made landfall early on Nov 8 in Guiuan municipality, Eastern Samar province, Eastern Visayas region.  The storm hit with 150mph winds and gusts up to 170mph.  Roads have been impacted in Region V and Region VIII.   There is no cell phone signal in Regions VII and VIII as well as 4 municipalities in Northern Cebu. Storm surges and flash floods have been reported in Eastern Samar and Leyte, causing significant damage to buildings and houses, according to UN OCHA. A landslide in Cebu has also been reported by the Cebu City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Strong winds and heavy rainfall have disrupted telecommunications,  limiting information coming out of affected areas.  UN OCHA requested information on population displacement , affected community needs  and international and national humanitarian support.  The deployment response is structured in three phases.  Here is an overview from each solution team member.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="font-size-2"><a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/standby-task-force">StandbyTaskForce (SBTF)</a>:  The Standby Task Force organizes digital volunteers into a flexible, trained and prepared network ready to deploy in crises; its main objective is to effectively assist crisis affected communities through co-operation with local and international responders.  The SBTF is currently filtering Yolanda tweets and images by relevance to disaster responders, using the  Micromappers’ Clickers software, then  geolocating and categorising those tweets and images for use in the ESRI and GIScorps maps, and as raw data for the Statistics Without Borders analyses.  Volunteers interested in working with the SBTF can find more information at<a href="http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/">http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/</a>; organisations interested in working with SBTF can contact <a href="mailto:coreteam@standbytaskforce.com">coreteam@standbytaskforce.com</a> directly.  </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="font-size-2"><strong><a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT</a></strong><strong><a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team">)</a></strong>:  HOT performs remote mapping based on satellite imagery by tracing roads, buildings, and landuse in affected areas.  Volunteers interested in supporting HOT can consult this <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan_(2013)">HOT Wiki Coordination page</a>.   Contact HOT at <a href="mailto:info@hotosm.org">info@hotosm.org</a> or mailing directly to the public mailing list at <a href="mailto:HOT@openstreetmap.org">HOT@openstreetmap.org</a>  If you have priority areas that your organization will be serving HOT can rapidly provide tracing of satellite imagery to create a basemap (assuming we have imagery for the area).  OpenStreetMap map data is released under the Open Database License (ODBL) and you can access it via the online map, load it onto your team’s handheld GPS units, or print out paper maps for your field teams using the <a href="http://fieldpapers.org/">fieldpapers.org</a> website.  As an additional benefit, if your ground teams write information on their printed Fieldpapers map with a pen and then you scan the page or take a picture of it with a camera and send HOT the resulting image, that information will be integrated back into the central database (things like road names, locations of schools, hospitals, etc).  You can also <a href="http://www.s1expeditions.com/p/openstreetmaps.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download daily updated Garmin Map Files for Garmin GPS handhelds</a>.  The maps are based on OSM data and are routeable (i.e. it will give you driving directions if you ask for it) </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="font-size-2"><a href="http://giscorps.org/">GISCorps</a>: Provides volunteer GIS services to underserved communities world wide both in post disaster, humanitarian relief, and capacity building.  For this deployment GISCorps is providing ad hoc Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping support to  team members in the form of online maps, and acted as co-lead (with Humanity Road) in the Yolanda-Palau activities.
