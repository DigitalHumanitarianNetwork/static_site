We have been contacted by United Nations Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs, the Philippines Red Cross to assist in providing information management support. Highlights:  On Nov 7h, the Digital Humanitarian Network received an activation request from the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  (UNOCHA) to support needs for Typhoon Yolanda.   Super Typhoon Yolanda made landfall early on Nov 8 in Guiuan municipality, Eastern Samar province, Eastern Visayas region.  The storm hit with 150mph winds and gusts up to 170mph.  Roads have been impacted in Region V and Region VIII.   There is no cell phone signal in Regions VII and VIII as well as 4 municipalities in Northern Cebu. Storm surges and flash floods have been reported in Eastern Samar and Leyte, causing significant damage to buildings and houses, according to UN OCHA. A landslide in Cebu has also been reported by the Cebu City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Strong winds and heavy rainfall have disrupted telecommunications,  limiting information coming out of affected areas.  UN OCHA requested information on population displacement , affected community needs  and international and national humanitarian support.  The deployment response is structured in three phases.  Here is an overview from each solution team member.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-2\"><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/standby-task-force\">StandbyTaskForce (SBTF)</a>:  The Standby Task Force organizes digital volunteers into a flexible, trained and prepared network ready to deploy in crises; its main objective is to effectively assist crisis affected communities through co-operation with local and international responders.  The SBTF is currently filtering Yolanda tweets and images by relevance to disaster responders, using the  Micromappers’ Clickers software, then  geolocating and categorising those tweets and images for use in the ESRI and GIScorps maps, and as raw data for the Statistics Without Borders analyses.  Volunteers interested in working with the SBTF can find more information at<a href=\"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/\">http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/</a>; organisations interested in working with SBTF can contact <a href=\"mailto:coreteam@standbytaskforce.com\">coreteam@standbytaskforce.com</a> directly.  </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-2\"><strong><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team\">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team\">)</a></strong>:  HOT performs remote mapping based on satellite imagery by tracing roads, buildings, and landuse in affected areas.  Volunteers interested in supporting HOT can consult this <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan_(2013)\">HOT Wiki Coordination page</a>.   Contact HOT at <a href=\"mailto:info@hotosm.org\">info@hotosm.org</a> or mailing directly to the public mailing list at <a href=\"mailto:HOT@openstreetmap.org\">HOT@openstreetmap.org</a>  If you have priority areas that your organization will be serving HOT can rapidly provide tracing of satellite imagery to create a basemap (assuming we have imagery for the area).  OpenStreetMap map data is released under the Open Database License (ODBL) and you can access it via the online map, load it onto your team’s handheld GPS units, or print out paper maps for your field teams using the <a href=\"http://fieldpapers.org/\">fieldpapers.org</a> website.  As an additional benefit, if your ground teams write information on their printed Fieldpapers map with a pen and then you scan the page or take a picture of it with a camera and send HOT the resulting image, that information will be integrated back into the central database (things like road names, locations of schools, hospitals, etc).  You can also <a href=\"http://www.s1expeditions.com/p/openstreetmaps.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download daily updated Garmin Map Files for Garmin GPS handhelds</a>.  The maps are based on OSM data and are routeable (i.e. it will give you driving directions if you ask for it) </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-2\"><a href=\"http://giscorps.org/\">GISCorps</a>: Provides volunteer GIS services to underserved communities world wide both in post disaster, humanitarian relief, and capacity building.  For this deployment GISCorps is providing ad hoc Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping support to  team members in the form of online maps, and acted as co-lead (with Humanity Road) in the Yolanda-Palau activities.

            "content_html": "<p>Members from the Digital Humanitarian Network (DHN)have activated to support and will be sharing their unique expertise for the <a href=\"http://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org\">World Humanitarian Summit</a>. DHN members have been mobilised by the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to support the preparation of the first World Humanitarian Summit.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The event organized by the United Nations will be held in Istanbul in 2016. The objective of the World Humanitarian Summit is to discuss the changing humanitarian landscape and ensure humanitarian action is fit to respond to the challenges of the future. Through a series of regional consultations, starting in June in West Africa, humanitarian actors will set the agenda for the summit. These consultations will cover four key themes: humanitarian effectiveness; reducing vulnerability and managing risks; transformation through innovation; serving the needs of people in conflict.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This long-term activation represents an opportunity for DHN members to position themselves as major players in the humanitarian field. Individuals interested in being a part of these projects can reach out directly to apply to volunteer with any of the active members.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over the next two years, DHN members will play a key role in the preparation work leading to the summit. They will assist with various tasks such as online mapping, statistical analysis, translations, social media amplification and online platform moderation. Some organizations are already involved in the preparations, others will step in as specific needs arise. Here is an overview from each solution team member.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/connected-development-code\">Connected Development CODE</a>: In collaboration with Statistics Without Borders, CODE is leading a request to provide analytical reports – using Google Analytics – on the traffic, demographics and behavior of users on the World Humanitarian Summit website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/disaster-tech-lab\">Disaster Tech Lab</a>: Disaster Tech Lab intends to share insights and experiences gained from more than four years of on-the-ground response work in the Caribbean, USA and the Pacific. Disaster Tech Lab views its participation in the World Humanitarian Summit as an opportunity to engage in discussions with other organizations on how to improve the available communications as part of disaster response and how digital technologies can address some of the bottlenecks currently encountered in disaster relief and humanitarian work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/urisas-giscorps\">GISCorps</a>: Over the next two years, GISCorps will supply several maps, such as a dynamic map representing the eight regional consultations and a map of participants. Also, members of GISCorps around the world will be able to provide on-site assistance at the regional conferences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/gnucoop\">GNUCOOP</a>: gnucoop is stepping forward to help develop or upgrade an interactive web-based platform already established by the World Humanitarian Summit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/humanity-road\">Humanity Road</a>: Humanity Road volunteers are providing public awareness and social media outreach in support to the regional consultations. Humanity Road is also collaborating with Statistics Without Borders on the analysis of millions of tweets collected by Humanity Road during <a href=\"http://humanityroad.org/sitrep/page/2/\">Typhoon Haiyan</a> in the Philippines (November 2013). The objective is to illustrate how the collection and analysis of social media at the onset and periodic times during an emerging disaster can be used. Also, two Humanity Road volunteers are acting as the main points of contact to coordinate requests and responses related to the World Humanitarian Summit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/info4disasters\">Info4Disasters</a>: Info4Disaster offers support to the regional consultations via social media general outreach. Additionally, in collaboration with OpenCrisis, Info4Disaster will facilitate an analysis and discussion of collaborations between traditional and digital humanitarian organizations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/peacegeeks\">PeaceGeeks</a>: PeaceGeeks will contribute to social media coverage and to graphic design. PeaceGeeks also offered to deploy its Amani website (CRM + mapping) development platform if there is a need.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/standby-task-force\">Standby Task Force</a>: The Standby Task Force helped coordinate the first phase of the activation request and has now taken up the role of observer. SBTF intends to contribute with experiences and developments on the event.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/statistics-without-borders\">Statistics Without Borders</a>: Statistics Without Borders is working with Humanity Road to provide analysis of Typhoon Haiyan response. SWB volunteers are also collaborating with CODE to provide analysis of the World Humanitarian Summit website traffic and behaviours.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/translators-without-borders\">Translators Without Borders</a>: Translators Without Borders (TWB) is providing  translation of documents in four languages through the TWB Workspace which connects professional translators volunteering their time to humanitarian organizations. In addition, TWB will contribute experience and information on the need to narrow the language gap during a crisis and will provide information on its Words of Relief translation crisis relief network currently being piloted.  </p>\n<p>More information about the World Humanitarian Summit can be found at <a href=\"http://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/\">http://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org</a></p>\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WHSummit\">https://www.facebook.com/WHSummit</a></p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHSummit\">@WHSummit</a></p>",

            "content_html": "<div>The overflow of information generated during disasters can be as paralyzing to humanitarian response as the lack of information. Mobile phones, orbiting satellites and humanitarian UAVs each generate vast volumes of data during major disasters. This flash flood of information is often referred to as Big Data, or Big Crisis Data. Making sense of this overflow of information is proving to be an impossible challenge for traditional humanitarian organizations, which is precisely why they’re turning to Digital Humanitarians.  </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Who exactly are these Digital Humanitarians? They’re you, me, all of us. Digital Humanitarians are volunteers and professionals from the world over and from all walks of life. What do they share in common? The desire to make a difference, and <i>they do</i> by rapidly mobilizing online in collaboration with international humanitarian organizations. In virtually real-time, they make sense of vast volumes of social media, SMS and imagery captured from satellites and UAVs to support relief efforts worldwide. How? They craft and leverage ingenious crowdsourcing solutions with trail-blazing insights from artificial intelligence.  </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>This book charts the sudden and spectacular rise of Digital Humanitarians by sharing their remarkable, real-life stories, highlighting how their humanity coupled with innovative solutions to Big Data is changing humanitarian response forever. Digital Humanitarians will make you think differently about what it means to be humanitarian and will invite you to join the journey online.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Book website: <a href=\"http://digital-humanitarians.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">digital-humanitarians.com</a></div>",
