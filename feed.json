We have been contacted by United Nations Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs, the Philippines Red Cross to assist in providing information management support. Highlights:  On Nov 7h, the Digital Humanitarian Network received an activation request from the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  (UNOCHA) to support needs for Typhoon Yolanda.   Super Typhoon Yolanda made landfall early on Nov 8 in Guiuan municipality, Eastern Samar province, Eastern Visayas region.  The storm hit with 150mph winds and gusts up to 170mph.  Roads have been impacted in Region V and Region VIII.   There is no cell phone signal in Regions VII and VIII as well as 4 municipalities in Northern Cebu. Storm surges and flash floods have been reported in Eastern Samar and Leyte, causing significant damage to buildings and houses, according to UN OCHA. A landslide in Cebu has also been reported by the Cebu City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Strong winds and heavy rainfall have disrupted telecommunications,  limiting information coming out of affected areas.  UN OCHA requested information on population displacement , affected community needs  and international and national humanitarian support.  The deployment response is structured in three phases.  Here is an overview from each solution team member.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-2\"><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/standby-task-force\">StandbyTaskForce (SBTF)</a>:  The Standby Task Force organizes digital volunteers into a flexible, trained and prepared network ready to deploy in crises; its main objective is to effectively assist crisis affected communities through co-operation with local and international responders.  The SBTF is currently filtering Yolanda tweets and images by relevance to disaster responders, using the  Micromappers’ Clickers software, then  geolocating and categorising those tweets and images for use in the ESRI and GIScorps maps, and as raw data for the Statistics Without Borders analyses.  Volunteers interested in working with the SBTF can find more information at<a href=\"http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/\">http://blog.standbytaskforce.com/</a>; organisations interested in working with SBTF can contact <a href=\"mailto:coreteam@standbytaskforce.com\">coreteam@standbytaskforce.com</a> directly.  </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-2\"><strong><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team\">Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT</a></strong><strong><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/humanitarian-openstreetmap-team\">)</a></strong>:  HOT performs remote mapping based on satellite imagery by tracing roads, buildings, and landuse in affected areas.  Volunteers interested in supporting HOT can consult this <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan_(2013)\">HOT Wiki Coordination page</a>.   Contact HOT at <a href=\"mailto:info@hotosm.org\">info@hotosm.org</a> or mailing directly to the public mailing list at <a href=\"mailto:HOT@openstreetmap.org\">HOT@openstreetmap.org</a>  If you have priority areas that your organization will be serving HOT can rapidly provide tracing of satellite imagery to create a basemap (assuming we have imagery for the area).  OpenStreetMap map data is released under the Open Database License (ODBL) and you can access it via the online map, load it onto your team’s handheld GPS units, or print out paper maps for your field teams using the <a href=\"http://fieldpapers.org/\">fieldpapers.org</a> website.  As an additional benefit, if your ground teams write information on their printed Fieldpapers map with a pen and then you scan the page or take a picture of it with a camera and send HOT the resulting image, that information will be integrated back into the central database (things like road names, locations of schools, hospitals, etc).  You can also <a href=\"http://www.s1expeditions.com/p/openstreetmaps.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download daily updated Garmin Map Files for Garmin GPS handhelds</a>.  The maps are based on OSM data and are routeable (i.e. it will give you driving directions if you ask for it) </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"font-size-2\"><a href=\"http://giscorps.org/\">GISCorps</a>: Provides volunteer GIS services to underserved communities world wide both in post disaster, humanitarian relief, and capacity building.  For this deployment GISCorps is providing ad hoc Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping support to  team members in the form of online maps, and acted as co-lead (with Humanity Road) in the Yolanda-Palau activities.

The objective of the World Humanitarian Summit is to discuss the changing humanitarian landscape and ensure humanitarian action is fit to respond to the challenges of the future. Through a series of regional consultations, starting in June in West Africa, humanitarian actors will set the agenda for the summit. These consultations will cover four key themes: humanitarian effectiveness; reducing vulnerability and managing risks; transformation through innovation; serving the needs of people in conflict.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This long-term activation represents an opportunity for DHN members to position themselves as major players in the humanitarian field. Individuals interested in being a part of these projects can reach out directly to apply to volunteer with any of the active members.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Over the next two years, DHN members will play a key role in the preparation work leading to the summit. They will assist with various tasks such as online mapping, statistical analysis, translations, social media amplification and online platform moderation.

            "content_html": "Translators without Borders (TWB) is pleased to announce funding from the Indigo Trust to extend its Ebola Words of Relief Extension project to more languages in West Africa. Additionally, the project will focus on distribution of the local language materials through various humanitarian networks and on the ground, ensuring that affected populations do receive critical information in their own languages. The funding by the Indigo Trust is intended to improve communications between aid workers and local populations in West Africa suffering from the Ebola epidemic. The funding, which enhances the Words of Relief Ebola Extension project initially funded by the Humanitarian Innovation Fund (HIF), recognizes the critical role language and translation play in improving crisis response and saving lives. Called “the modern era’s worst health emergency,” by the World Health Organization, the Ebola epidemic is a crisis of information, a crisis of communications and, ultimately, a crisis of language. In September, UNICEF found that in Sierra Leone, thirty percent believed Ebola was transmitted via mosquitos and another thirty percent believed it was an airborne disease. The project supports efforts to reduce the information gap by providing simple messages, posters, public service announcements and voice over in six languages: Krio, Themne, Mende, Fula, Malinke, and Pidgin English (audio only) for the most affected populations in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. The team hopes to extend the project to other key local languages as well, such as Bambara in Mali. Importantly, the Indigo Trust funds allow the Translators without Borders team to focus on distribution and dissemination of local language content. “We train community translators and work with professional translators volunteering their time, all working very hard to improve access to information in local languages,” said Rebecca Petras, Translators without Borders Program Director. “It is critical that we make sure that the translations are presented well, printed, and distributed. With this project, we are now able to make sure that the materials are actually used.” Translations, which have already begun, are completed by rapid response translation teams made up of either professional translators or community translators trained by Translators without Borders. Current content is provided by International SOS, WHO/UNICEF and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), but the project intends to expand the source messaging to more organizations as well as national government messaging. Words of Relief is currently being piloted in Kenya with Swahili and Somali. The pilot, funded by the HIF and Microsoft, creates a database of local language crisis content that can be extended throughout the world. It also includes development of rapid response ‘spider networks’ into local languages and development of an online tool to link aid workers directly to rapid response translation teams.",

This twenty page guide and report contains helpful tips for emergency managers.</p>\n<p>Emergency Management is a mature field of study but Social Media Analytics is still in its infancy and navigating this field requires an understanding of the opportunities it presents.   We are publishing this guide as a helpful tool for emergency managers and decisions makers to help them identify and discuss relevant questions in planning their SMEM response.  One example of key lessons to include in your own SMEM plan is establishing a baseline for communications activity in your area of operation.</p>\n<p>Download Here <a href=\"http://humanityroad.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/HRSWB-SMEM-Guide-FINAL-20141106.pdf\">HRSWB SMEM Guide FINAL 20141106</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Extract:</strong><br><em>“While the idea of leveraging social media is intuitively attractive, there are a number of key considerations to ensure that the analysis is designed to meet the objective. The opportunity for data analysis must be properly and promptly identified, and the disaster response resources and the analytical resources must work together to determine how to best house, extract, and analyze the data.  The parameters and the specifics of the social media data to be extracted for analysis must be carefully defined and understood based on the objectives of the analysis.”</em></p>\n<p>Examining the use of social media across space and time may signal a change or development in the behavior of people and their use of social media. For example, the results of this type of analysis may be useful for the design and prioritization of outreach programs as well as top-down communication from the government towards affected populations.  Using a subset of data collected, analysts can provide a geographic display of tweets over time for a specific location. This might be tweets about urgent needs, damage or some other topic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Transformation through innovation is possible through discovering, testing and leveraging digital humanitarian and technology partners.  Knowing how to tap these partners is crucial for quickly responding to disaster in your region.  We are really excited to be working with partners such as Statistics Without Borders, Translators Without Borders and technology partners such as ESRI and encourage emergency management professionals to reach out to start talking with potential data management partners.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The members have been working very actively this past week to support the public aid agencies responding to those impacted by Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines. The members of the Digital Humanitarian Network are diverse in their operating structures, mission and focus and in some cases have direct overlap in the roles and support they provide.  But through collaborative work, the sum of their efforts is much greater than its individual parts.</p>\n<p>And this is their story.</p>\n<p>Hagupit, the twenty-second named storm and the eleventh typhoon of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Pacific_typhoon_season\">annual typhoon season</a>, started as a tropical storm on December 1 and then became a typhoon the next day. It <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_deepening\">explosively intensified</a> into a Category 5 super typhoon on December 4. Subsequently, Hagupit began a weakening trend before making its first landfall in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Samar\">Eastern Samar</a> as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon.</p>\n<p>Below is a high level overview of how innovative members of the Digital Humanitarian Network are helping to provide information aid and crisis mapping.</p>\n<p>The Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) have further developed the Humanitarian Information Review and Analysis (HIRA) database in collaboration with DHN.  This is being done in order to facilitate the systematic collection and tagging of published information related to humanitarian needs, so that response efforts can be targeted to areas of greatest need, and trends can be monitored over time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/disaster-tech-lab\">Disaster Tech Lab</a> has deployed to the island of Cebu in the Philippines to provide emergency communications services and internet access for communities affected by the recent typhoons. They are building indoor &amp; outdoor wifi networks, VSAT &amp; 4G backhaul links as well as VoIP services.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/esri-disaster-response-program\">Esri Disaster Response Program</a> has formally activated and is providing the ArcGIS platform for display of mapping products that are the output of collaborative response efforts among many government agencies and volunteers, including Standby Task Force and GISCorps.

Volunteers monitored and relayed urgent needs to agencies responding. The organization has also published an initial 3W report. The Humanity Road Social Media 3W report is an early report listing the aid agencies mobilizing and supporting a disaster and includes their social media account information. The organization is also working with GISCorp and ESRI Crisis Response on mapping initiatives. Humanity Road hosts the ESRI ARCGIS platform.  Humanity Road is activation lead for the World Humanitarian Summit and during the activation relayed some of the innovation work to the #ReShapeAid dialogues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalhumanitarians.com/content/info4disasters\">Info4Disasters</a> is providing emotional support for digital volunteers and monitoring for indications of burnout and compassion fatigue.

The organization is using Micromappers, the AIDR platform and Verily.</p>\n<p>The SBTF collaborated with Rappler and Project Argos during this deployment. Our volunteers have been supporting their Alert Map, and their volunteers have engaged with the SBTF. This collaboration has identified another critical response partner in the work we do. SBTF would like to thank, Zak Yuson, and his team for all their support.  The collaboration with MicroMappers, Qatar Computer Research Institute (QCRI) has contributed to a greater understanding of these tools, and hopefully contributed to fine-tuning of the functionality and capability of the Artificial Intelligence system.  GISCorps joined forces with the SBTF with their mapping skills to complete the geo-location of tweets and images.
